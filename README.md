# MrBeast Maze — Evidence Archive

This repository documents observable patterns, timelines, and behavioral signals
present across selected MrBeast / Beast Philanthropy videos and related artifacts.

The archive is intended as a neutral, auditable record of observations and
structure. It does not attempt to solve, decode, or claim outcomes.

---

## Scope

- No claims of solution or final answers
- No speculative conclusions or assertions of intent
- Only documented observations, timelines, and sourced references

This repository focuses on *what is observable*, not *what is inferred*.

---

## Structure

- `/timeline`  
  Canonical chronological ordering of relevant videos and artifacts.

- `/evidence`  
  Per-artifact documentation containing verbatim descriptions, pinned comments,
  and external links.

- `/behavioral_analysis`  
  Synthesis of observable patterns and systemic signals derived from evidence,
  clearly separated from raw documentation.

- `/appendix`  
  Supporting materials, raw links, and working notes used during compilation.

---

## Methodology

All entries prioritize:

- Date-based ordering
- Direct source linking
- Separation of observation from interpretation
- Incremental, versioned updates

Edits are preserved through commit history to maintain transparency and auditability.

---

## Maintenance

This archive is maintained as a living document. New observations are appended
with context; historical entries are not retroactively rewritten.
