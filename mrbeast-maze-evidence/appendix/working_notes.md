# Working Notes

> Non-authoritative scratchpad.
> Observations here are provisional and must be validated before promotion
> into evidence or timeline files.

## Verification Tasks

- Confirm pinned comments (text + timestamp) for each archived video
- Capture description excerpts verbatim (current state)
- Record view count snapshots for reference (optional)
- Check for edited descriptions or added links post-upload

---

## Open Questions

- When was the “Missing a playlist? Use this one” comment first pinned?
- Were any videos retroactively added to the playlist?
- Do any artifacts appear in multiple playlists simultaneously?

---

## Structural Notes

- Timeline entries must link only to `/evidence/*.md`
- Appendix files are never cited by timeline or pillars
- Behavioral analysis must remain evidence-derivative only

---

## Items to Revisit

- Consider adding an evidence file for the playlist artifact itself
- Monitor for Stage 3 or post-playlist artifacts
- Re-check navigation links after GitHub upload completion

---

## Administrative

- Repository initialized locally, then uploaded via GitHub UI
- Git not yet configured locally (author/email pending)
- All markdown files created before population
