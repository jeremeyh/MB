# Pillar I — Maze as Filter

> This document synthesizes observable structural patterns across documented
> artifacts. It does not assert intent, outcome, or solution.

---

## Purpose

Pillar I exists to document **filter-like properties** that emerge from
observable structures within the archived artifacts.

The term *filter* is used descriptively, not conclusively, to indicate that
certain conditions, constraints, or progressions appear to differentially
permit or restrict continuation.

---

## Scope

Included:
- Structural constraints visible within artifacts
- Rule-bound environments
- Time-based progression requirements
- Conditional continuation mechanics

Excluded:
- Claims of purpose or intent
- Assertions of selection outcomes
- Psychological inference
- Audience targeting assumptions

---

## Observable Filter Characteristics

Across documented artifacts, the following **structural characteristics** are
recurrently observable:

- Environments governed by explicit rules
- Progress dependent on sustained compliance
- Increasing constraint over time
- Limited optionality once engagement begins
- Clear termination conditions

These characteristics are documented as *present*, not *designed*.

---

## Environment as Constraint

Several artifacts feature environments that function as bounded systems:

- Physical containment (e.g., enclosed or isolated spaces)
- Temporal containment (fixed or compounding durations)
- Resource limitations (sleep, food, comfort, exit options)

Within these environments, continuation is conditional.

---

## Progression Without Guarantee

Observed structures often include:

- Advancement through endurance rather than skill
- Rewards contingent on persistence, not completion certainty
- Escalation of difficulty without explicit narrative signaling

Continuation is possible but not assured.

---

## Non-Interpretive Framing

This pillar does **not** conclude that:

- A selection is occurring
- An audience is being tested
- Outcomes are intentional
- The system has a hidden endpoint

It documents only that **filter-like mechanics are observable**.

---

## Relationship to Other Pillars

- Pillar I documents *what constrains*
- Pillar II documents *how information moves*
- Pillar III (reserved) may document *systemic interaction* if warranted

No pillar operates independently.

## Notes

This synthesis remains provisional and may evolve as new artifacts are added.
Revisions append context; prior observations are preserved.
