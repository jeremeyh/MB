# Pillar II — Signal Transmission

> This document describes how information is packaged, surfaced, and made
> reviewable. It does not analyze content meaning or intent.

---

## Purpose

Pillar II exists to document **observable signal hygiene** — how artifacts are
structured for clarity, auditability, and external review.

This pillar focuses on *form*, not *content*.

---

## Scope

Included:
- Documentation structure
- Navigation clarity
- Separation of observation vs synthesis
- Versioning and traceability practices

Excluded:
- Interpretive claims
- Behavioral conclusions
- Outcome inference
- Speculation about audience or intent

---

## Observed Packaging Principles

The archive follows these observable conventions:

- Chronological anchoring via a single canonical timeline
- One-directional linking (timeline → evidence → analysis)
- Explicit separation between raw documentation and synthesis
- Minimal prose density to reduce interpretive bias
- File naming optimized for scanability and recall

These principles are structural, not semantic.

---

## Repository Conventions

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/timeline/`
  - Canonical chronological spine
  - Observation-only records
- `/evidence/`
  - Per-artifact documentation
  - Verbatim excerpts preserved
- `/behavioral_analysis/`
  - Pattern synthesis
  - Explicitly non-conclusive
- `/appendix/`
  - Raw links and working notes
  - No narrative framing

Each layer serves a distinct review function.

---

## Review Flow (Non-Prescriptive)

A reviewer can reconstruct context by:

1. Reading the Master Timeline
2. Opening linked evidence files
3. Consulting behavioral synthesis only after documentation

This flow minimizes narrative priming.

---

## Notes

This pillar intentionally avoids:
- Claims of signaling intent
- Assertions of selectivity
- Statements of audience targeting

Its role is to document *how* information travels, not *why*.
