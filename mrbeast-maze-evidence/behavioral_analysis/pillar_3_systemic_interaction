# Pillar III — Systemic Interaction

> This document records observable interaction patterns that emerge when
> individuals engage with structured environments over time.
>
> No claims are made regarding selection, testing, reward, or intent.

## Purpose

Pillar III exists to document **how engagement unfolds** within structured
systems, based on observable behaviors and constraints.

It does not infer motives, objectives, or outcomes.

---

## Scope

Included:
- Repeated engagement across constrained environments
- Sustained participation over time
- Interaction with rule-bound systems
- Escalation of commitment requirements

Excluded:
- Claims of evaluation or judgment
- Psychological inference
- Statements of success or failure
- Attribution of purpose

---

## Observable Interaction Patterns

Across documented artifacts, the following patterns are observable:

- Entry is optional, continuation is conditional
- Rules are disclosed upfront or early
- Progress requires sustained compliance
- Exits are available but terminate participation
- Rewards, where present, correlate with duration

These are described as **present**, not **designed**.

---

## Engagement Over Time

Participation often requires:

- Repeated decision-making under constraint
- Tolerance for ambiguity
- Willingness to continue without certainty of outcome
- Maintenance of engagement despite escalating difficulty

No assumption is made that these traits are sought, tested, or rewarded.

---

## Systemic Friction

Observable systems frequently include:

- Limited feedback during engagement
- Absence of explicit progress indicators
- Delayed or cumulative outcomes
- High cost of early exit relative to continued participation

These characteristics are documented without interpretation.

---

## Relationship to Other Pillars

- Pillar I documents **constraints**
- Pillar II documents **information flow**
- Pillar III documents **interaction within constraints**

Together, the pillars describe structure, movement, and engagement —
not outcome or intent.

---

## Notes

This pillar remains provisional and may be refined as additional artifacts
are documented. Revisions append context rather than overwrite prior entries.
